### This project has been paused.
This project was paused at December 2021. Since then, Heroku, which is the hosting service I used to keep the bot running, has removed it's free services. In the meantime, Discord announced that all bots have to implement slash commands as the only way for users to interact with the bot, as bots' access to regular chat messages will be revoked. Hence, this bot is no longer working, and currently there are no plans to resume the project because I am busy now.
